%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\aboutme{I am a 23 year old easygoing, hard working and passionate Master student at Aalborg University. Who enjoys being a part of a team working on solving complex engineering problems. I have a particularly interest in automation and robotics. My skill set is evolving around these interest and includes modelling of dynamical systems, state estimation theory, optimal control and implementing control solutions for systems with real-time requirements.} % To have no About Me section, just remove all the text and leave \aboutme{}

\begin{twenty} % Environment for a list with descriptions
	\twentyitem{2016-}{M.Sc. Master of Science in Engineering in Control and Automation\\ at Aalborg University}{}{Through my studies I have been practicing project-oriented work and cooperated with a broad range of students on solving complex problems. Therefore, I find it natural to engage into new projects and teams. Through my studies, I have been developing skills and experience with developing and implementing control and estimation systems for various dynamical systems with real-time requirements. With special focus within the field of robotic applications. I have especially been working with and applying Non-Linear Control Theory, State Estimation Theory, Multi-Agent systems and Model Predictive Control. Within my master thesis I am working with Cooperative Intersection Management for multiple autonomous vehicles. This project has especially allowed me to obtain experience with both theoretical and practical challenges related to optimization-based control of multi-agent systems.}
	\twentyitem{2013-2016}{B.Sc. Bachelor of Science in Electronic Engineering and IT\\ at Aalborg University}{}{Through my studies, within the field of Electrical Engineering and IT, I have obtained knowledge about design and implementation of analog electronics as well as digital electronics. Furthermore, I have obtained a strong theoretical and practical foundation within mathematics and programming for solving a broad range of complex engineering problems.}

	\twentyitem{2017-}{Student Helper}{Job}{Student Helper within the section for Wireless Communication Networks at Aalborg University.\\ This job is evolving around a test platform developed to support student projects related to self-driving vehicles. Within the job my responsibilities has been ranging from developing and maintaining the test platform, introducing new students to the platform and at various occasions representing the University by presenting ongoing activities within the department of Electronic Systems. One example is the annual Folkem√∏de at Bornholm in Denmark. Which I attended to present and promote the Universities activities within the field of self-driving vehicles. Furthermore the job let me to attending the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona 2018. I attended the congress as technical support for a demonstration by Nokia Bell Labs. The demonstration was to a great extent based on work I had performed in my position as student helper. From the employment as Student Helper I have gained experience with. Communicating scientific work to a broad range of audience with different background and education level. Experience with developing and implementing a control and estimation system for small scale self-driving cars.}
